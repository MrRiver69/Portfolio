        Hey! I’m a game designer and 3D modeler who loves building worlds and experiences that players can really connect with. 
        I enjoy every part of the process, from coming up with ideas and designing gameplay, 
        to modeling environments and making sure everything feels alive and immersive.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I’ve always loved the balance between the creative and technical sides of game development.
        Whether I’m experimenting with new tools or refining my workflow,
        I’m always looking for ways to grow and push my skills further.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For me, games are more than just entertainment they’re experiences that can make people feel something, think differently, or just escape for a while.
        That’s what drives me to keep creating and exploring new ideas.
      </p>
